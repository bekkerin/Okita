//  THERE ARE THREE TYPES OF JUMP STATEMENTS: RETURN, BREAK, CONTINUE. THIS EXAMPLES ONLY COVERS RETURN. BREAK AND CONTINUE COME ON PAGE 232.  SO FAR WE HAD VOID FUNCTIONS, NOW WE HAVE THE FUNCTIONS RETURN SOMETHING. 

// THIS SHOWS THAT FUNCTIONS ARE ABLE TO RETURN SOMETHING, LIKE A ZOMBIE
//THE CAMERA HAS THE RETURNZOMBIE SCRIPT
//THE ZOMBIE CYLINDER HAS THE ZOMBIE SCRIPT ATTACHED.
// KEEP BOTH THE SCENE AND GAME WINDOWS OPEN, SINCE THE DRAWLINE ONLY SHOWS UP IN THE SCENE WHEN WE PLAY, NOT IN THE GAME WINDOW. MOVE THE ZOMBIE WITH THE ASWD KEYS (FPS SCRIPT IMPORTED AND ATTACHED TO ZOMBIE).
// WE NEED TO PUT THE DRAWLINE UNDER BOTH START AND UPDATE, SO THE LINE IS DRAWN FROM THE VERY START(ALTHOUGH ADMITTEDLY, THE FIRST REFRESH IS PRETTY FAST - BUT THERE MAY BE OTHER REASONS WHY WE WANT TO HAVE THE ZOMBIE FOUND FROM THE START).
