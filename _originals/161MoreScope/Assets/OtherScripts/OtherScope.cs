// book says that there is a script OtherScope in this directory, so I renamed the SomeOtherScope script to OtherScope

using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;

public class SomeOtherScope : MonoBehaviour {

	// Use this for initialization
	void Start () {
	    // this  script is just for demonstrating that having multiple scripts of the same name is not possible unless they have different scope
	}
	
	// Update is called once per frame
	void Update () {
	
	}
}
